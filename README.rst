Although IPv6 has been around since 1998, some big parts of the internet are IPv4 only.

since World IPv6 Launch day, which was on 6 June 2012, global IPv6 traffic has grown more than 500%.

However, the adoption at major websites is still bad, even though they should have the money, time
and people to enable IPv6, and stop being an IPv4-only service.

This repository contains code to check some websites (including their nameservers) for their
reachability via IPv6, and will produce a static website containing the results.
